# `AngularJS Basic App` - Customer Manager

This is a basic Angular JS app that displays a customer manager application. Done by following a tutotial called "AngularJS in 60 minutes by Dan Wahlin".



##`angular-seed` â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.


## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local directory.
```
git clone git@github.com:raafa16/AngularBasicAppv2.0.git
```


Browse to the local directory. We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-seed` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
